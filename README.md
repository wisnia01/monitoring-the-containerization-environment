# About the project
The goal of this project is to show different conceptions regarding: 
- VOD streaming with various protocols, especially HTTP-based ones like HLS and MPEG-DASH,
- advantages of HLS and MPEG-DASH such as Adaptive Bitrate Streaming,
- creating streams with ffmpeg solution,
- Kubernetes, including its architecture, our infrastructure and horizontal scaling.
- Monitoring and Observability, especially of Kubernetes environments
- The Four Golden Signals of monitoring and The Three Pillars of Observability
- Monitoring metrics using kube-state-metrics, Prometheus and Grafana
- Collecting and agregating logs using EFK stack - Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana. 
- Instrumenting applications with OpenTelemetry, collecting traces with it and analyzing them in Jaeger

The project consists of two main parts: one focusing on streaming and the horizontal scaling of streaming applications on Kubernetes, and the other addressing the monitoring and Observability of the Kubernetes environment. Additional information can be found in the documentation located within the `docs/` directory.
